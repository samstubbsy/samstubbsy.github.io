# Features
* Mixes two liquids over a short distance.
* Bi-directional: liquid can enter through either end of the the device (with differing mixing efficacy).

# Intro to Print-in-Place
* There are many situations in which homogenous mixing of small volumes of fluids is necessary, particularly in biomedical fields. One practical example is in the creation of bioinks: https://www.mdpi.com/2310-2861/7/4/227.
* Maximizing mixing over a minimal distance allows for conservation of expensive fluids. A long serpentine path would be an effective mixer, but it requires a lot of fluid to be held up in the device for that mixing to occur. Thus, a short, effective mixing section can be a major money saver.

# Design decisions
* Channel width = 0.35 mm: wide enough for accurate print resolution, thin enough for highly effective mixing
* Serpentine channel provides greater opportunity for mixing (effective)
* Pyramids carved out of straight channel allow for 3D mixing - fluid "folds over" itself (effective)
* Various shaped obstacles (some with 3D pyramid cutouts) intended to increase mixing (ineffective)

# Fabrication instructions
* Print mold on a VPP resin printer with sufficient resolution using black or high-temp resin.
* Wash device for 5 minutes on the print bed.
* Remove device from bed and wash for another 5 minutes in fresh IPA.
* Let your device dry for 30 minutes before curing. Confirm that the inside of the mold
has a homogenous sheen. Glossy areas indicate that uncured resin is still present, which
will inhibit the crosslinking of PDMS.
* Gently blow off any debris between your uFluidicâ€™s channel. Use compressed air if necessary. Do not touch the inside of the uncured mold.
* Perform a 10 second surface cure.
* Coat mold in parylene.
* Cast device in mold using PDMS.
* Plasma bond glass slide to PDMS device.
