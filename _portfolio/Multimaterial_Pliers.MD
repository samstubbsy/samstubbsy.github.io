# Features
* Mixes two liquids over a short distance.
* Bi-directional: liquid can enter through either end of the the device (with differing mixing efficacy).

# Intro to Print-in-Place
* abc
* abc

# Design decisions
* Channel width = 0.35 mm: wide enough for accurate print resolution, thin enough for highly effective mixing
* Serpentine channel provides greater opportunity for mixing (effective)
* Pyramids carved out of straight channel allow for 3D mixing - fluid "folds over" itself (effective)
* Various shaped obstacles (some with 3D pyramid cutouts) intended to increase mixing (ineffective)
